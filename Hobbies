            <h3>Do the thing you fear and the death of fear is certain-Well, these are some of the lines which motivate me now and always.<br></h3>
            <ul><b>
                <li>The lines are picked up from a certain book I read a way time back. Initially I'm very fond of reading books in my spare time which basically includes novels and non-fictious books at times.</li>
                <li>I'm also an enthusiast Sports player with my major focus being on Badminton as I've been playing this since class 3 and I've ended up representing my school at various inter-school and intra-school competitions and was able to make till the district level at a pretty young age.</li>
                <li>I'm more of an introvert nature which makes me spend most of my time on my own and i end up liking my own company the most and read about different people and things and explore the world around me.</li>
                <li>I'm not a movie/ web-series type of person who would end up watching them rather I'd like to read the stories based on them or stories on them.</li>
